        "- ### __SQL Injection Protection:__ Django’s querysets and ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) provide a secure way to interact with databases. They use parameterization to ensure that user input is treated as data, not executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks.\n",

        "- ### __Use Parameterized Queries:__ Avoid using raw SQL queries that concatenate user input directly into the query string. Instead, use Django’s ORM or parameterized queries, which separate data from code and prevent SQL injection.\n",
        "- ### __Keep Dependencies Updated:__ Regularly update Django, its dependencies, and any third-party libraries you use in your application. This ensures you benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes.\n",
        "- ### __Implement Strong Authentication:__ Enforce strong password policies that require users to create complex passwords with a mix of characters. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.\n",
        "- ### __Use HTTPS:__ Implement HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server. This protects sensitive data transmitted over the network, such as login credentials and financial information, from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
        "- ### __Principle of Least Privilege:__ Grant users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This limits the potential damage in case of a compromised account."
